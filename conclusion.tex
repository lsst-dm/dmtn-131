\section{Other issues to consider}
We may still wish to keep a copy of data out of the cloud e.g. in Chile and/or NCSA.

We have not considered bulk transfer of data to other partners - this may be far too expensive via google.

\section{Conclusion}

LSST \gls{DM} has been constructing a cloud ready system for many years. We believe commercial cloud is the correct approach but we may be a few years ahead of commercial and federal cost models aligning. We hope that we may be able to partner with google to usher in a new ear of federally funded research in the cloud.
