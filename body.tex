\section{Introduction}
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\gls{LSST}) will usher in a new era of astronomy, the observing program will observe the southern sky repeatedly over 10 years in 6 bands providing an unprecedented  census of the astrophysical bodies in the universe.  Funded bu \gls{NSF} and \gls{DOE} this key observatory is due to go into operations in October 2022.

Producing 20TB a night this is a huge step up in data acquisition from other optical telescopes. At its conception it was considered an ominous data volume requiring highly specialized computing infrastructure. These days, however, industry is handling this sort of data flow without problems. LSST  operations are expected to cost tens of millions a year with order of \$10M computing budget.

We have made some experiments to show that we could potentially use commercial cloud providers for at least a large part of the \gls{LSST} \gls{Data Management}.  The barrier to acting on this is price and uncertainty on future pricing.

A solution might be to agree a fixed price partnership on the experiment where google agree to \emph{do what is needed} for success at some reasonable and agreed annual fee.
